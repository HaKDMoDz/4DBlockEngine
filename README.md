4DBlockEngine
=============

This is a prototype block engine in Monogame (previously Unity) being built mostly for practice. 

Requires Monogame (download from: http://www.monogame.net/downloads/)
Once Monogame has been installed, and its location to the path variable (i.e. C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\MonoGame\v3.0)
Some build scripts currently only run on Windows. This will hopefully get fixed soon.
